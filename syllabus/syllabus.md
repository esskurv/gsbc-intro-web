# ME 220 Intro to Web Programming (Coding)

## Class Description

In this class, you will be introduced to web programming. This includes computer science fundamental concepts, how the Internet works, using an integrated development environment, using the command line, programming frontends with HTML/CSS/JavaScript, and backends with PHP/MySQL. The concepts are enforced with several programming assignments and a semester long project developing a website.

## Grading

There are 6 homework assignments worth 100 points, a midterm project goal worth 200 points, and a final project goal worth 200 points. The total number of points for the class is 1000. Together they are proportioned as follows:

* 60% Assignments
* 20% Midterm Project Progress
* 20% Final Project Progress

Final grades are rounded to the nearest integer and then assigned to a letter grade. The grading scale is listed in the following scale:

| Grade |  Range   |
| :---: | :------: |
|   A   | 90 - 100 |
|   B   | 80 - 89  |
|   C   | 70 - 79  |
|   D   | 60 - 69  |
|   F   |   < 60   |

## Semester Project

You have a major semester assignment to create a website using a Linode instance. You will define two major goals for your semester assignment and discuss this in your first assignment. The goals should be Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Timely (SMART). You should also give the URLs of two websites that you find particularly interesting (i.e. you want to know how they work). To be perfectly clear, whatever comes in your mind initially is probably too ambitious and needs to be broken down. We will discuss this in class further.

To accomplish, you should apply the Rule of the Loop (Schell, 2020, **The Art of Game Design**): *The more times you test and improve your design, the better your app will be.*

* How can I make every loop count?
* How can I loop as fast as possible?

## Linode

The cost of running a tiny node on Linode is about $5/month. You must get this working by the time the first assignment is due.
