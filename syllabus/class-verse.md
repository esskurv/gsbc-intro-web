> "For when God made promise to Abraham, because he could swear by no greater, he sware by himself,  <sup>14</sup> Saying, Surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee.  <sup>15</sup> And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise.  <sup>16</sup> For men verily swear by the greater: and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all strife.  <sup>17</sup> Wherein God, willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed it by an oath:  <b><sup>18</sup> That by two <u>immutable</u> things, in which <u>it was impossible for God to lie</u>, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us:</b>  <sup>19</sup> Which hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and stedfast, and which entereth into that within the veil;  <sup>20</sup> Whither the forerunner is for us entered, even Jesus, made an high priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec." (Hebrews 6:13-20)

> "**God is not a man, that he should lie**; neither the son of man, that he should repent: hath he said, and shall he not do it? or hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good?" (Numbers 23:19)
