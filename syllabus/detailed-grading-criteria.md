# Detailed Grading Criteria

## Homework Criteria

The homework grading is is graded as follows:

* (30 points) The homework solves the three requirements (1o points each) in the assignment. Full credit is received if the requirement is met. If it does not work, but a good attempt is made, half credit is earned.
* (20 points) GitHub has descriptive commit messages (less than 50 characters, describes work checked in). A message like "check in homework" would receive half credits and a message like "fixed logic to handleInput() method" would receive full credit.
* (30 points) HTML, CSS, and JavaScript should be stored in separate files. While it is possible to combine all three kinds of code in one file, it's not scalable for large projects. Keep them the HTML in `.html`, CSS in `.css`, and JavaScript in `.js` files to the maximum extent possible.
* (10 points) Source code needs to be documented. Half credit is given if every function has a descriptive comment. Full credit is given if the internals of a function also have descriptive comments.
* (10 points) Web sites need to be polished. Full credit is given if the web site has design and style applied. Try to come up with a nice CSS style to accompany your web sites. This credit is given if the homework is supposed to be a Markdown file.
